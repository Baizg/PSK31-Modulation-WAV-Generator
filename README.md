# PSK31-Modulation-Generator
A C++ based QPSK/BPSK wav file generator that follows the PSK31 spec but allows for a a symbol rate of 250/500 Sym/s. Utilizes Varicode for both and the Convolutional Code for QPSK.

Currently BPSK is fully functional with the raised cosine filter and audio generated is nearly identical to other standard generators.
